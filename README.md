# Advanced-Machine-Learning
This project is a demonstration of advanced machine learning analysis on California housing dataset.

## Objective
To buid a machine learning model to predict house prices in California using the data collected on 20k+ homes

## Steps Followed
* The data is loaded form sklearn.datasets and converted to dataframe
* Preliminary information is extracted from the dataframe and is cleaned
* EDA and descriptive statistics with correlation and plots
* Removing identified outliers
* Preprocessing pipeline (scaling and encoding) using sklearn
* Feature selection through linear model backward elimination
* Train-test splitting
* Build Linear model and residuals pattern
* Build non-linear machine learning models and check out of sample performace for each model
* Pick the best model to predict house price
